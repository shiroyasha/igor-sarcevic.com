#Programming is my passion

Programming is, and always was a thing that could satisfy my craving for challenges. I think and truly hope that **tehnology** combined with **great ideas** can bring a change to this world that can only a few dream about. With programming there are **no limits**, fake borders or rules that can stop us to create something **amazing**. We just have to **work hard** and **believe in the magic**.

So if you, **visitor of this strange page**, have something you want to build and need some help with it or even a crazy fanboy who will share your ideas with the world, please feel free to **contact me**.
