#Making a change in the world is my life goal

It seems such a **simple** and **childish** wish, yet there are **no** better words to
describe what I want to achive. I want
to **build**, to **explore**, to **create**, to make
my friends **proud** and to achive something truly valuable.

Problem **solving** runs throught my veins. I
like **big** challenges, seemingly **impossible** ideas, and I feel the happiest when all the odds
are against me. I like to compete with others, to show them what I'm **realy worth**, I like to make **friends**, to cooperate with great **minds** and even greater **ideas**.
