#Making the world a better place is my life goal.


I enjoy to explore new **ideas**,
to do things that that seem **impossible** to others,
to **share** my knowledge,
and to create and build **impressive** and truly great things.

I like to think of myself as a
**general problem solver**,
an out of the box thinker,
and of course one of **the best**
front-end developers you can find.

My life goal is to bring 
**fun** and **joy** into peoples lives 
through technology and science.
