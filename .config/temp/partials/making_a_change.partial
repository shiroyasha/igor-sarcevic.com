<h1 id="making-a-change-in-the-world-is-my-life-goal">Making a change in the world is my life goal</h1>
<p>It seems such a <strong>simple</strong> and <strong>childish</strong> wish, yet there are <strong>no</strong> better words to
describe what I want to achive. I want
to <strong>build</strong>, to <strong>explore</strong>, to <strong>create</strong>, to make
my friends <strong>proud</strong> and to achive something truly valuable.</p>
<p>Problem <strong>solving</strong> runs throught my veins. I
like <strong>big</strong> challenges, seemingly <strong>impossible</strong> ideas, and I feel the happiest when all the odds
are against me. I like to compete with others, to show them what I&#39;m <strong>realy worth</strong>, I like to make <strong>friends</strong>, to cooperate with great <strong>minds</strong> and even greater <strong>ideas</strong>.</p>
