<h1 id="programming-is-my-passion">Programming is my passion</h1>
<p>Programming is, and always was a thing that could satisfy my craving for challenges. I think and truly hope that <strong>tehnology</strong> combined with <strong>great ideas</strong> can bring a change to this world that can only a few dream about. With programming there are <strong>no limits</strong>, fake borders or rules that can stop us to create something <strong>amazing</strong>. We just have to <strong>work hard</strong> and <strong>believe in the magic</strong>.</p>
<p>So if you, <strong>visitor of this strange page</strong>, have something you want to build and need some help with it or even a crazy fanboy who will share your ideas with the world, please feel free to <strong>contact me</strong>.</p>
