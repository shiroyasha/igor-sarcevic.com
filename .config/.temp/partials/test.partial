<h1 id="making-the-world-a-better-place-is-my-life-goal-">Making the world a better place is my life goal.</h1>
<p>I enjoy to explore new <strong>ideas</strong>,
to do things that that seem <strong>impossible</strong> to others,
to <strong>share</strong> my knowledge,
and to create and build <strong>impressive</strong> and truly great things.</p>
<p>I like to think of myself as a
<strong>general problem solver</strong>,
an out of the box thinker,
and of course one of <strong>the best</strong>
front-end developers you can find.</p>
<p>My life goal is to bring 
<strong>fun</strong> and <strong>joy</strong> into peoples lives 
through technology and science.</p>
